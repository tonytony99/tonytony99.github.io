				<p> An interactive app I made using shiny in R. Given constraints on available ingredients, you can
				tweak the recipes of food products and see how it effects the optimum ratio in which they should be made.
				The maximum possible profit is calculated using the lpSolve library. </p>

				<p> A demonstration of the surprising nature of the Monty Hall problem. Play the game and watch 
				as switching doors is proven to be the better strategy. Alternately you can simulate many	games with each strategy. </p>

				<p> Using reinforcement learning to teach an agent to navigate a scrolling obstacle course. The image above shows
				many paths taken by the agent to navigate the obstacle course as it learns the best action for different states. This 
				project was inspired by the Flappy Bird game. This project is best viewed in R studio. </p>
